# [SPEED TYPING GAME](https://toto-kotaro-tanaka.github.io/ms2-speed-typing-game/)
This is a website of a speed typing game with an additional function that users can learn about information of the countries. I create this for **Milestone Project 2 (Interactive Frontend Development), Full Stack Software Development** in **[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)**, Ireland.  

It is a mobile responsive website however the speed typing game can be played on a laptop or desktop only as a keyboard is required. The link to the website is available **[HERE](https://toto-kotaro-tanaka.github.io/ms2-speed-typing-game/)**.<br>

## WHO'S THIS WEBSITE FOR? <a name="whos-this-website-for-heading"></a>
People who would like to practice typing by playing a game. Names of the countries in the world are being used for the texts so they might come across the countries that they might be interested in or never heard of during the game. In case they would like to check what those countries are like, there is a **‚ÄúLet's Learn About The Countries‚Äù** section to provide information of each country, such as a flag, region, capital city, population, language(s), a location on google maps and a link to Wikipedia* page if users would like to know more details of the countries.

> **Note:**<br>
> *During the process of creating the website, an idea that Wikipedia, which will give users more details about the countries if they wish to do so, can be implemented using REST Countries API so this is implemented in the project now, although it is not written on the initial project plan

<div align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">üîù</a></div>

## WHO IS THE OWNER? <a name="who-is-the-owner-heading"></a>
I am the owner of the website. My goals for this website are to provide a speed typing game that users can practice typing with fun as well as to provide information of countries that they come accross in the game. The website is build considering **‚ÄúUsers First‚Äù**. As the typing game is only playable with a keyboard (that is usually a laptop computer or desktop computer), there is a clear alert for users on a mobile and tablet sizes to inform this. The alert can be hidden by users once they get the message so it does not interrupt users all the time. There are some text and buttons are hidden on the mobile and tablet sizes so that it prevents users accidentally start the game. Even though the game itself is not playable on the mobile and tablet sizes, users can still see what the game is like so the game instructions button and other elements of the game (e.g timer, input, score and high score) remain on the page. 

There are very clear and enough buttons and links to go from "Speed Typing Game" page to "Let‚Äôs Learn About The Countries" page, and vice versa so users have no issue of accessing on both sections whenever they would like to do. Very simply written game instructions give users clear information of how to play the game and what is involved in the game. The game instructions page is one of the menus so it is accessible from both pages as well as there is an additional button, which is coloured in Bittersweet (#ff6565) to stand it out, on the speed typing game page.  The instructions show on a modal so users remain on the page and once they read and understand it, they can close the instructions and play the game immediately.

Once the game starts, the play button is disable. This is to prevent some system errors as they could press it during the game and causes issues of it. Once the game is over, input field is disabled for the same reason as the play button. The website is kept very simple as there should not be so many different things for simple game, however, by using nicely contrasted colours, the game dose not look to be boring.

Keeping high score in the game gives users a very good motivation to keep playing the game to get higher score. 
When the game is over, users get a medal depending on the scores and this also give users motivation to try it again and again. There is a secret crown for someone who achieve better than gold medal. This is not written on the instructions, however, users are notified once they reach the gold medal to continue the game so this is not just hidden item.   

To provide information of the countries, display is kept very neat and tidy so that they can see basic information of the countries easily. If users would like to know more details of the countries, a link to Wikipedia, that automatically goes to the page of the country, is also available. (implemented this during the process)

<div align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">üîù</a></div>

## UX 5 PLANES <a name="ux5-planes-heading"></a>
### Strategy Plane <a name="strategy-plane-heading"></a>
Users are people who would like to practice speed typing. By creating a website as a type of gaming website, they can practice while they are having fun. By setting a time (60 seconds per game), scores, which increments by 10 points rather than 1 point so that they feel they achieve better (e.g. When you get 20 correct typings, it shows 200 points instead of 20 points), and a medal depending on the score, users know what their current typing skill is and can compare in 1 week - 1 month time how they improved.
A high score remains even after the game finishes and even the browser is closed so that it remains as a target and users can try to achieve more points and give them a motivation to continue the game more times. A name of countries is used as a text and it comes up randomly so that different combinations of texts appear on each game. Names of the countries come from **[REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/)** and there are 250 countries listed in the API, as of 3 Jan 2021. Users may know some countries quite well, some only little and some not at all. In case users come across the countries that they are interested in, there is a section of **‚ÄúLet's Learn About The Countries‚Äù** on a different page that provides basic information of each country, such as a flag, region, capital city, population, language(s), a location on google maps, and link to Wikipedia page (implemented this during the process) as an additional function to the speed typing game. 

The main aims for this website are;

* To allow users to practice speed typing with fun. In order to achieve this, the visual and functions are kept minimum. There is a logo with the title, navbar to lead to *Home*, *Instructions*, and *Countries* on the header. For the screen size below 62rem / 992px, there is an alert that tells users that the game is only playable on laptop or desktop only as a keyboard is required to play it. In the main section of the page, there is a welcome message, game instructions button, a 60-second timer, a button to link to the **‚ÄúLet's Learn About The Countries‚Äù** page, a letter display, an input box, game start button, a scoreboard, a medal display, a high scoreboard.<br>
To give users more motivation, each correct point is set to 10 instead of 1 so that they fee they achieve better.
There are also 3 different medals at the end of the game. Depending on the score, they get a Gold medal for 230 points or higher, a Silver medal for 180 - 220 points, and a Bronze medal for 170 points or below. There is a special secret crown for those who achieve a very high score. This is not written on the instructions as it is a secret item, however, once you get a Gold medal, you get a message to achieve 250 points and see what happens.

* To provide basic information of countries in the world. 
In order to achieve this, there is a dropdown menu that users can select a country. **[REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/)** is linked with the website to show a flag, region, capital city, population, and language(s). Google Maps API is used for the location display, Wikipedia (implemented this during the process) is used for more details of the countries and both are also linked with REST Countries API.

All the functions on the tables below are minimum that must be implemented on the website to achieve user's and owner's goals.  

| Opportunity                                            | Importance | Viability / Feasibility |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :---------------------: |

Below are the additional functions that can improve the website however not mandatory to achieve user's and owner's goals, that are currently set up. Some aren't implemented due to a lack of my current skills and knowledge and some due to lack of time. 

| Opportunity                                            | Importance | Viability / Feasibility |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :---------------------: |

> **Note:**<br>
> *Keeping The Highest Score Even Game Disconnected - During the review of materials in Code Institute, realise that this is not difficult thing to achieve so it is implemented in the game

### Scope Plane <a name="scope-plane-heading"></a>
Features to be included in this project are;
* Game instructions on modal (A modal is used to keep the number of pages minimum)
* Timer 
* Randomly selected letters (country names) when the game starts
* Counting score 
* Keeping a high score
* Displaying customised and interactive message (e.g. The results of the game, details of the countries)
* Google maps with API
* Country information with API
* Caution message* in a modal when the size goes below 62rem / 992px as the game is playable on a laptop or desktop only

> **Note:**<br>
> *Realise that caution message does not need to be in modal so set it up as an alert, which is better than using a modal

### Structure Plane <a name="structure-plane-heading"></a>
The website consists of 2 pages and a modal
* **`index.html`** is **Speed Typing** game page with a logo, navbar, an alert (for table & mobile screen sizes), welcome message, game instructions button, a timer, a button to countries page, letter display, input box, a start button, a reset button, a scoreboard, medal display, a high scoreboard
* **`countries.html`** is **‚ÄúLet's Learn About The Countries‚Äù** page. The same header as the first page ~26 alphabets with a list of countries for country information~ and simple display of country information with a dropdown menu. Location displays on google maps
* **`Modal`** is used for **Game Instructions**, which have very clear rules of the game and what includes in the game

### Skeleton Plane <a name="skeleton-plane-heading"></a>
The desktop-first design, though Bootstrap4 is used and it is also a mobile responsive website. The Speed Typing game is only playable on a laptop or desktop but it is still visible on the mobile and tablet sizes. Country information is available on both desktop and mobile sizes. There are wireframes of the Main page (index.html) and Countries page (countries.html) for desktop and mobile sizes.

* [Wireframes: Home](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux/wireframe-index-html.png)
* ~[Wireframes: Countries](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux/wireframe-countries-html.png)~
* [Wireframes: Countries](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux/wireframe-countries-html-2.png)*

> **Note:**<br>
> *This is the revised version after looking for some better ideas showing the country details

### Surface Plane <a name="surface-plane-heading"></a>
**--- Colour ---**<br>
On the **"Speed Typing"** game page (index.html), a page that looks similar to Visual Studio Code is considered because the main purpose of the website is for typing. **Eerie Black (#1e1e1e)** is used for the background colour and **Bright Navy Blue (#007acc)** is used for the logo and menu. Main text colour is **Light Grey (#d4d4d4)** so that it does not give users too much contrast between the text and background colours. 
**Canary (#ffff98)** is used for a score to stands out the score and stronger colour than Canary, which is **Maximum Yellow (#fdf838)** for a high score. **Bittersweet (#ff6565)** is used for a timer because it is very important information and must be clearly displayed during the game. 

On the **‚ÄúLet's Learn About The Countries‚Äù** page (countries.html), **Bright Navy Blue (#007acc)** is used for the background of information and google maps as it links to an image of the earth and presents it well. The main text colour is ~Eerie (#1e1e1e) so the page looks like the reversible version of index.html~ **Light Grey (#d4d4d4)** as Eerie on Bright Navy Blue do not match.

**--- Typography ---**<br>
**Courgette** which is a similar type of font to the logo (Lobster) is used for the menu to show the image of "Speed". **Bebas Neue** is used for headings to stand out the headings and **Montserrat** is used for main contents to make the fonts visibility and readability maximum so that users do not have any issue of reading it especially for typing game.

<div align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">üîù</a></div>

## FEATURES <a name="features-heading"></a>
### Existing Features <a name="existing-features-heading"></a>
* Created with **HTML5**, **CSS3** (with Bootstrap4 framework), **JavaScript** (with jQuery library)
* It consists of 2 individual pages, one is for "Speed Typing" game and one is for "Country Information" display
* Modal for game instructions
* Text of typing, country information is from **[REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/)**
* Google Maps API for location display
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to show details of selected countries

### Features Left To Implement <a name="features-left-heading"></a>
* Setting different levels - I think I could implement this by setting a length of text (e.g. Easy for text length up to 10 characters) however currently do not have time to do this and as it is not essential to achieve user's goals, I leave this out
* Having a user name - This would give users a more customised game however currently do not have time to implement this. Also from the design's point of view, it may look too busy to have user's name on the speed typing game page and defeats the purpose of simple page, I leave this out
* Highlighting Letters When Correct / Incorrect - This would be helpful especially when letters are quite long. I currently do not have the skills to implement this and not essential for the game so I leave this out
* Counting Down Last 10 Seconds - This would also be useful as users may not be able to take their eyes off while they are typing, although, a timer is relatively close to the text display & input box so should be visible. Giving a warning by sound would be a nice function to have. I currently do not have the skills and time. The game currenly has no sound at all so it might be a bit of disrupting if users hear a counting sound suddenly so decide to leave it out this time

## TESTING <a name="testing-heading"></a>
### Html <a name="html-heading"></a>
**--- Code Validation ---**<br>
When I complete the core HTML code, I test it using **[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)**, which is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium that allows checking HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup, to check any warnings and errors.

**`index.html`**: [2 Warnings and 3 Errors](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/w3c-index.png)
1. **Warning: Empty heading**<br>
This causes due to not having any text in `<h3>` tag. As this heading is for the "Time is Up!" message, which is generated by JavaScript at the end of the game, no text is required in it and according to the [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23739224/empty-heading-warning-on-html5-validation#:~:text=The%20%22empty%20heading%22%20warning%20means,any%20content%20associated%20with%20it.&text=You%20are%20instead%20using%20the,the%20semantics%20of%20the%20tag.), having no text in `<hN>` tag is still valid HTML and passes the validation. However, I decide to fix the issue so I put the message in `<h3>` tag and to use `show()` method on JavaScript instead of `html()` method, which actually works out better coding as a result

1. **Warning: Empty heading**<br>
Very similar issue as the warning 1. A country name that is randomly generated from API goes into `<h2>` tag for the game. I want to show "Ireland" as the first country, that is currently set up by JavaScript, I put it as a text anyway to remove the warning. The code on JavaScript still remains the same because a randomly selected country shows on `<h2>` despite of having Ireland as a text without the code on JavaScript

1. **Error: Element `ul` not allowed as child of element `ol` in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)**<br>
`ul` is not properly nested in `ol` according to [Nested HTML List](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_unordered.asp) on W3Schools. Put `ul` inside `<li> </li>` to solve the issue

1. **Error: The `aria-describedby` attribute must point to an element in the same document.**<br>
Refer to [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute) regarding the issue and fix it by putting **text-input** which is the id name of the element 

1. **Error: The `aria-labelledby` attribute must point to an element in the same document.**<br>
Refer to [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute) regarding the issue and fix it by putting **game-instructions** which is the id name of the element 

**- Conclusion -**<br>
Put the code on the validator after fixing these, test it, and receive **[no warnings or errors](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/w3c-index-report.pdf)**<br>
*There is a message about **Images with textual alternative** which is a reminder about images and alt. Refer to [this post](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/methods-for-displaying-gallery-images-with-titles/354087) and also [this website](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) to understand this message. As this is not an error, no further action is taken.*

**`countries.html`**: [1 Warning and 3 Errors](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/w3c-countries.png)
1. **Warning: Empty heading**<br>
The same type of issue as No 2 on `index.html` (not the same issue as this occurs in the different section) and solve the error in the same way

1. **Error: Bad value for attribute `src` on element `img`: Must be non-empty.**<br>
In order to solve the issue, put the URL of the flag of [Ireland in REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/data/irl.svg) that should show first when the page is loaded

1. **Error: Element `ul` not allowed as child of element `ol` in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)**<br>
The same issue as No 3 on `index.html` and solve the error in the same way

1. **Error: The `aria-labelledby` attribute must point to an element in the same document.**<br>
The same issue as No 4 on `index.html` and solve the error in the same way

**- Conclusion -**<br>
Put the code on the validator after fixing these, test it, and receive **[no warnings or errors](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/w3c-countries-report.pdf)**<br>
*There is a message about **Images with textual alternative** which is a reminder about images and alt. Look at [this post](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/methods-for-displaying-gallery-images-with-titles/354087) and also [this website](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) to understand this message. As this is not an error, no further action is taken.*

**--- Quality ---**<br>
When I complete the majority of HTML, I test the quality of the website using **[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)**, which is an open-source, one of the automated dev tools for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO. Anything 89 or below are looked at to improve the quality of the website.  

**`index.html` Mobile Size**<br>
Before - [Performance: 85 / Accessibility: 97 / Best Practices: 93 / SEO: 83 ](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/lighthouse-index-mobile-before.png)<br>
After - [Performance: 92 / Accessibility: 97 / Best Practices: 93 / SEO: 92 ](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/lighthouse-index-mobile-after.png)<br>
* Issues on Performance and SEO are addressed and solved with suggestions by Lighthouse. The issues on Performance are fixed by reducing the size of the logo and removing one of Bootstrap JavaScript, which is not necessary to be on index.html. The issue on SEO is fixed by adding `<meta name="description"/>` tag.

> **Note:**<br>
> Score of Performance varies. It may depend on internet speed(?)

**`index.html` Desktop Size**<br>
Before - [Performance: 95 / Accessibility: 88 / Best Practices: 93 / SEO: 90 ](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/lighthouse-index-desktop-before.png)<br>

* Issues on Accessibility are addressed and solved with suggestions by Lighthouse. The issues are fixed by adding `aria-label="Play game button"` attribute on two buttons that have no label. This is important for screen readers. Also, there is `<h3>`(Time is Up message) after `<h4>` which causes heading elements not being a sequentially-descending order so `<h3>` is changed to `<h4>`

* Main reason of low Performance is caused by **Eliminate render-blocking resources** that jQuery and Bootstrap files are rendered but not being used sufficiently. This is confirmed by the [coverage](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/lighthouse-countries-mobile-render.png) on Chrome DevTools. Talk to my mentor about the issue and he suggests to use minified jQuery code on jquery.js file and use it instead of linking to jQuery CDN. This does not improve the [Performance](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/html-testing/lighthouse-countries-mobile-after.png). I have a final meeting with my mentor so will discuss this with him once again but if it is not resolved, I'd need to leave the issue as it is, as all the functions are working fine and the issue is only the performance on mobile size

### Css <a name="css-heading"></a>
**--- Code Validation ---**<br>
When I complete the core CSS code, I test it using **[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**, which is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium that allows checking Cascading Style Sheets, to make sure that CSS complies with the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium

**`styles.css`**: [0 Error](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/css-testing/no-errors.png) / [16 Warnings](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/css-testing/warnings.png)

* 16 warnings are related to WebKit, which is one of [web browser rendering engines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3468154/what-is-webkit-and-how-is-it-related-to-css). By looking at a[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52490004/what-are-all-of-these-w3c-css-validation-warnings-about) post and a [Code Institue Slack](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/css-testing/webkit.png) thread, no further actions are required so decide to leave them as they are

### JavaScript <a name="javascript-heading"></a>
**--- Code Validation ---**<br>
When I complete the core JavaScript code, I test it using **[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)**, which is a static code analysis tool used in software development for checking if JavaScript source code complies with coding rules

* **25 Warnings**<br>
Most of them are expressions being used in ES6 (e.g. arrow function and let / const, ) Fixed them by putting /*jshint esversion: 6 */ on main.js as suggested. There are 2 that semicolon is missing so solve the issues by putting semicolonn on them. My understanding is not to use semicolon for curly braces, however it is required for statements according to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717949/when-should-i-use-a-semicolon-after-curly-braces)

* **6 Undefined Variables**<br>
These are $, Anime, transferData, lat, lng and google. $ is jQuery symbol so it can be ignored. Anime TBC with mentor, transferData, lat and lng are solved by creating a global variable for them. Google TBC with mentor

* **1 Unused Variable**<br>
This is something to do with google maps. TBC with my mentor

**--- Functions ---**<br>
When I complete the core functions of JavaScript for Speed Typing game, I test it using **[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)** which is a framework for testing JavaScript code to see if they work. 

Below are the steps of the set up for the testing.

1. Create a testing folder called **speed-typing-jasmine** on my desktop<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/jasmine1.png))

1. Open the file with **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** which is my Integrated Development Environment (IDE)<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/jasmine2.png))

1. Create **`index.html`** which is an HTML document for testing, **script** and **spec** folders and **`speed-typing.js`** which is actual JavaScript in the **script** folder, and **`speed-typing-spec.js`** which is testing JavaScript in the **spec** folder<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/jasmine3.png))

1. Create a boilerplate on **`index.html`**<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/jasmine4.png))

1. Add Jasmine **CDNs** on **`index.html`**. CDNs are from **[cdnsjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jasmine)**. They must be added inside **`<head>`** and the <ins>order of CDN is very important</ins>. It must be **`jasmine.js`** --> **`jasmine-html.js`** --> **`boot.js`** --> **`jasmine.css`** in order to make testing work correctly<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/jasmine5.png))

1. Add script of **`speed-typing.js`** and **`speed-typing-spec.js`** on **`index.html`**. They <ins>can be inside</ins> **`<head>`** unlike usual JavaScript scripts (usually, JavaScript scripts are located at the bottom of **`<body>`**). As the boilerplate create **`<body>`** tag, I put them in there. The <ins>order of JavaScript script is very important</ins> and it must be **`speed-typing.js`** (Main JavaScript file) --> **`speed-typing-spec.js`** (Testing JavaScript file) to load the files correctly<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/jasmine6.png))

To test the functions, I use **"Red Green Refactor"** method which purposely fails it first and makes it pass writing just enough code to pass afterward. The reason for this is because it could pass the test even code doesn't work and it is important to do tests from different angles.<br>
I test 2 functions here. One is **showCountries** function which takes a country name as an argument from a list of countries and other one is a function which contains **if else statement**.

**showCountries Function**
1. Write a description code of **clickButton** with **showCountries** function in it on **`speed-typing-spec.js`** and run it expecting to be <ins>failed</ins> as there is no showCountries function defined<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries2.png))

1. Create **showCountries** function on **`speed-typing.js`** but still expecting to be <ins>failed</ins> as there is no country defined<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries3.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries4.png))

1. Create a valuable called **let country = "Ireland"** and returning a value of "country" expecting to be <ins>passed</ins><br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries5.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries6.png))

1. This function should have **country** as a parameter and take it as an argument so add **expect(showCountries(country)).toBe(country);** on **`speed-typing-spec.js`**. Run the test expecting that "should show Ireland to be <ins>failed</ins>" but "should show countries to be <ins>passed</ins>"<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries7.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries8.png) / [Screenshot 3](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries9.png))

1. Remove "should show Ireland" as this function should be used taking the country as an argument and show names of countries from the list<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries10.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/show-countries11.png))

**- Conclusion -**<br>
**showCountries** function works in the way expected

**Function With If Else Statement**<br>
This function should show a correct medal depending on the score. Below is the category of each medal.
* Bronze: score <= 240
* Silver: score >= 250 && score <= 290
* Gold: score >= 300 && score <= 340
* Special Crown: score >= 350

1. Write description code of **scoreCategory** with **getMedal** function with **Bronze Medal** category which has a value of 240 in it on **`speed-typing-spec.js`** and run it expecting to be <ins>failed</ins> as there is no getMedal function defined<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal2.png))

1. Create **getMedal** function on **`speed-typing.js`** but still expecting to be <ins>failed</ins> as there is no score defined<br>

1. Change the value to 250 expecting to be <ins>failed</ins>. This is just to see if the value is effecting correctly<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal7.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal8.png))

1. Add **Silver Medal** category which has a value of 250 on **`speed-typing-spec.js`** expecting to be <ins>failed</ins> as there is no **if statement** defined for this yet<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal9.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal10.png))

1. Add **else if** statement of (score >= 250 && score <= 290) on **`speed-typing.js`** returning a value of "Silver" expecting to be <ins>passed</ins><br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal11.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal12.png))

1. Add **Gold Medal** category which has a value of 300 on **`speed-typing-spec.js`** and add **else if** statement of (score >=300 && score <= 340) on **`speed-typing.js`** returning a value of "Gold" expecting to be <ins>passed</ins><br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal13.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal14.png) / [Screenshot 3](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal15.png))

1. Add **Special Crown** category which has a value of 350 on **`speed-typing-spec.js`**, and add **else** statement on **`speed-typing.js`** returning a value of "Crown" expecting to be <ins>passed</ins><br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal16.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal17.png) / [Screenshot 3](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal18.png))

1. Add a value in **String** on **`speed-typing-spec.js`** expecting to be <ins>failed</ins><br>

1. Add additional **if else** statement on **`speed-typing.js`** and define only if the type of score is **number**, then go to next **if else** statement, expecting to be <ins>passed</ins><br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal21.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/javascript-testing/get-medal22.png))

**- Conclusion -**<br>
Function with **if else** statement works in the way expected

### Web Browser <a name="webbrowser-heading"></a>
**--- Visibilities, Functions and Interactions ---**<br>
The website is available on major web browsers, such as **Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox**, **Opera** and **Microsoft Edge**. To make sure all the functions work properly on those browsers, the below manual testing are carried out on all of them.

1. Open the website on the browser to do a visual test. Look at all the pages including the modal (game instructions) to see if everything appears as expected<br>
([Chrome](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/chrome1.png) / [Safari](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/safari1.png) / [Firefox](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/firefox1.png) / [Opera](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/opera1.png) / [Microsoft Edge](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/edge1.png))

1. Click all the buttons and links to see if they link to the place supposed to go, open an external link in the separate page<br>

1. Play the game to see if interactive messages during the game (timer, score, country text) and after the game work (time is up, medal, medal message, high score, reset button and message)<br>
([Chrome During The Game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/chrome2.png) / [Chrome After The Game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/chrome3.png))<br>
([Safari During The Game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/safari2.png) / [Safari After The Game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/safari3.png))<br>
([Firefox During The Game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/firefox2.png) / [Firefox After The Game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/firefox3.png))<br>

1. Change a country randomly to see if all the information comes up correctly, including a link to Wikipedia
([Chrome Country Info](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/chrome4.png) / [Chrome Wikipedia](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/chrome5.png))<br>
([Safari Country Info](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/safari4.png) / [Safari Wikipedia](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/web-browsers-testing/safari5.png))<br>

**- Conclusion -**<br>
The website works on all the major web browsers

> **Note:**<br>
> The quality of Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge images are not great because they are tested in the other computer and screenshots are taken there and transferred as smaller size of images. To have consistent size of images, images of Chrome and Safari are adjusted so their qualities are not great either but all still visible 

### UX <a name="ux-heading"></a>
**--- Evidence Of Achieving The Website From UX Point Of View ---**<br>
There are some essential elements to achieve good user experiences on the website and this is to test and confirm that all the elements required for good useer experiences are there.

**`Header`**<br>
The logo of the website has clear meaning and can be easily identified what the website is for. Menu is well displayed and there is an icon of a person to show the current location of the page. The game is playable on a laptop or desktop size computer only, so once the screen size goes below 62rem / 992px, an alert comes up for the users so users are clearly informed that the game is not playable without a keyboard. The alert can be closed by users once they get the message.<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/header1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/header2.png))

**`Heading`**<br>
The display of fancy Headings (Welcome To Speed Typing Game! / Let's Learn About The Countries!), which appear very smoothly, gives users an impression of speed and it can be easily linked with the main pourpose of the website that is to practice speed typing. There is a short paragraph to explain what you can do on the page and there is a link to other page in the paragraph. On the speed typing page, there is an instructions button with stand out colour, positioned above the game section so that it cannot be missed. This is not a complicated game so users could easily figure out how to play the game, however, there are some important notes on the instructions (e.g. letter cases and space matter, points for each medal etc). Instructions are written clearly with minimum points, and on a modal so that users can stay on the game page<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/heading1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/heading2.png))

**`Speed Typing - index.html`**<br>
Very simple display not to disturb users for typing, but all necessary elements such as a timer, text for typing, play button, scoreboard, medal, high scoreboard are included. Plenty of icons are used to make the website more for gaming.  When users click the play button, it automatically focuses the input box so that they do not need to click it. This is written on the instructions as well as there is a very small but enough action (box shadowing) when the input box is selected so users notice it. <br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing1.png))

When the game starts, colour of the the play button is changed and deactivated. This is to prevent users clicking it again as it causes issues. Message for play button disappears so that users can focus on the main text, which is bigger and different to other fonts, only for typing. The score increments by 10 points as users get correct typing. This is to give users better feeling that they achieve more (e.g. 20 correct typings, 20 points vs 200 points)<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing2.png))

Once the game is over, there is a message of "Time is Up!" to let users know it is finished. The input box is disabled as well to avoid users still typing words and getting scores. There is a medal (with a message) comes up a second later when the game is finished, then there is a message of "Try again!" with reset button come up after a second later. The reason of this is if all the messages appear after the game at the same time, it looks too many letters suddenly on the screen and uses would not know what message are new so some messages get delayed purposely. If users achieve the highest points, high score is automatically updated. It remains after the game and even the web browser is closed so users can always go back to play the game targeting the high score. There is a button to countries.html page so users can access to the information page immediately if there are any countries that they want to look at.<br>
 ([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing3.png))

 On the mobile and tablet size that the game is not playable, the play button is hidden so that users will not be able to play the game but users can see the most of elements of the game, including the instructions, so that they can still get ideas of the game.<br> 
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing4.png))

The scores for the medals are considered by some factors. First, look up goole to see what the average speed typing for ordinary people is. It says [40 words per minute](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing5.png) (1.5 seconds per word for 60 seconds) so set up around 350 points (1.7 seconds per word) as the gold medal considering it would slighly take longer time to type country names than words because country names are longer than words. (e.g ‚ÄúI will go to your house‚Äù have 6 worlds / 16 letters compare to Antigua and Barbuda is a country name, which has 17 letters). When the game is completed, I, who can reasonably type well, try the game numerous times and discover that scores are over estimated as my scores are always around 150 - 220 points. I ask a few people to try the game to get feedback for analysis. My colleague who uses a computer on a daily basis get [150 points](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing6.png) average and a friend of mine who also uses a computer often get scores between [130 - 200 points](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing7.png), which are very similar scores as mine. To practice speed typing game and achieve reasonable speed, you are required to get 150 - 220 so set up medal categories in those scores. A gold medal and special crown are achievable for any users once users have reasonable typing skills (and with luck as well) and for those who achieve special crown, it proves that users will not require speed typing practice anymore. <br>

To make sure the correct medals show up depending on the scores, test it by changing the increment value of score on [`main.js`](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing8.png)and check the scores between medals.
* [50 points to expect Bronze](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing9.png)
* [170 points to expect Bronze](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing10.png)
* [180 points to expect Silver](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing11.png)
* [220 points to expect Silver](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing12.png)
* [230 points to expect Gold](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing13.png)
* [240 points to expect Gold](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing14.png)
* [250 points to expect Crown](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing15.png)
* [500 points to expect Crown](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing16.png)

The function to keep the high score is also tested with this. After 220 points, put 250 points to see if the high score remains the same when 230 points are achieved. Also, there is a message to indicate there is something more once you get a gold medal so the secret crown is noticible in the game.<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing17.png))

In REST Countries API, there are some countries that have special letters other than alphabet (e.g. √Öland Islands, C√¥te d'Ivoire etc). Those countries cannot be used as a text for typing so it is made sure to exclude them by setting **`if statement`**. This is checked by putting `console.log()` function in `showCountries` function and check on console of Chrome DevTools and confirm that any countries with special letters do not appear as a text.<br>
([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing18.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing19.png) / [Screenshot 3](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/speed-typing20.png))

**`Country Info - countries.html`**<br>
Blue back ground, which gives users image of the world, is used. The colour is nicely contrasted with the main back ground colour as well. Country info display is kept simple for good readability and icons are used to keep the design of the website consistent. The section of county info and google maps are split into 4 : 8 to give maps enough size. If users wonder where the information comes from, there is an info icon beside the dropdown menu that they can control open and hide and there is a link, which opens in a different page, to REST Countries API. For those who want to know more about the countries, there is a link to Wikipedia page, which also opens in a different page so that users do not leave the page. There is a button to index.html so that can access to the page easily whenever uses feel wanting to play the game<br>
([Screenshot](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/country-info1.png))

To check if the information of each country corresponds properly from API and Wikipedia links work, 5 different types of countries are picked up for testing. Select below countries and check against Wikipedia that is opened from the link on this page<br>
* A county with single alphabet: Angola ([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/angola1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/angola2.png))
* A county with special letters: Cura√ßao ([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/curacao1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/curacao2.png))
* A country with multiple alphabet: Lao People's Democratic Republic ([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/lao1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/lao2.png))
* A country with brackets: Korea (Republic of) ([Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/korea-republic-of1.png) / [Screenshot 2](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/korea-republic-of2.png))

> **Note:**<br>
> There are 2 minor issues found during randomly looking at the country info. 
> * No information of **["Heard Island and McDonald Islands"](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/heard-island1.png)** as there are [no information in the AP](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/heard-island2.png)
> * Wikipedia link for **["Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba"](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/bonaire.png)** show [Caribbean Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Netherlands) even though Wikipedia of each country exists. As those 3 are a listed as a group in the API, this is the way Wikipedia recognises it.
>As these are very minor issues and not worth mentioning on the website, no further action is taken and left as they are
 
**`Feedback From A User`**<br>
When the speed typing game is provisionally completed, request in Code Institute Slack to play it to get some feedback about the game. One of the users mentions that he comes across the same countries 3 times during the game and suggested [to prevent it happening](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/feedback1.png). My initial understand is that as there are 250 countries in the API, chances of getting the same country during the game is quite low but this is incorrect and as a matter of the fact, I come across the same countries during the game a few occasions so decide to implement this, which improves the website from UX point of view. To achieve this, create an empty array and put the randomly selected countries in it. Then, use [`include()`](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/feedback2.png) method that if the randomly selected country is <ins>NOT</ins> included in the array, then show the country name, otherwise to run `showCountries()` function again. To test this, modify if statement in `[showCountries()]` function to select countries with [4 or less letters](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/feedback3.png) so that there are only limited number of countries to be tested. Then, get a list of countries, which match the criteria, by using [`for loop and if statement`](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/feedback4.png) from the API and show these on console on Chrome DevTools. There are [10 countries match the criteria](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/feedback5.png), start the game showing the countries in the array on console. No countries are repeated and once those 10 countries are selected within the time, the system gives an error saying all the countries are selected and no more to be selected. [By looking at the countries in the array and receiving the error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/ux-testing/feedback6.png), it is confirmed that no countries are repeated during the game and the setting is properly done

**- Conclusion -**<br>
The website meets all the necessary elements to achieve good user experiences

<div align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">üîù</a></div>

## PROJECT BARRIERS & SOLUTIONS <a name="barriers-solutions-heading"></a>
**--- Disabling Play Button ---**<br>
Once the basic functions of the game are completed, test them by playing the game. During the game, notice that the play button is still active and by clicking it during the game, it causes some issues such as reducing the time in the timer and  even the time becomes 0, it continues to count with minus time and also replaces a text for typing. Looked for a solution and discover that buttons can be disabled so implement this once the game starts to prevent the issues. <br>
([Issue of counting time](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/button-disabled.png))

**--- Disabling Input Box ---**<br>
This is similar issue as the play button. As long as the input box is active, scores increment by 10 points even after the game so use the same method to prevent the issue.<br>
([Score 110 just after finished game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/inputbox-disabled1.png) / [Still incrementing score 140 even after game](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/inputbox-disabled2.png))

**--- Hiding Elements By JavaScript ---**<br>
To achieve good UX experiences for the website, there are some messages and buttons set to hide and show. The rest button and its message only appear after the game, so `class="d-none d-lg-block"` Bootstrap class is used to hide the elements on mobile / tablet size and css `display: none;` method to hide them on a laptop and desktop size. When setting this up to show after the game using JavaScript, it does not work because of `class="d-none d-lg-block"` class so solve the issue by putting these elements in a div and putting `class="d-none d-lg-block"` class on the div.<br>
([Initial setting both elements have class="d-none d-lg-block"](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/hide-element1.png) / [Putting elements in div with class="d-none d-lg-block"](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/hide-element2.png))

**--- Linking APIs ---**<br>
Set up REST Countries API by looking at [Code Institute lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9buYAnJ74&feature=youtu.be) and youtube tutorial([Coding Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THZyM2z8s-o)), set up Google Maps API by looking at [Code Institute lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYFyb3S4oRc&feature=youtu.be) but cannot link both together to show a selected country on Google Maps. Look for guidance on google, however, cannot find anything to achieve this so try to move code around thinking of the logic of how REST Countries API and Google Maps API work and manage to link them up together by putting `showCountryOnGoogleMaps(lat, lng)` function with two parameters to locate a selected country on Google Maps inside `displayCountryInfo` function to show country information of selected country.<br>
([Function to show selected country on google maps](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/api.png))

**--- Showing Country Names As Text ---**<br>
Texts (country names) for typing come from REST Countries API. When working on this function using the local server, use only necessary functions and elements. During the test, everything works fine but when these are transferred to main.js, which has other code, `showCountries(countries)` function to show countries name as texts do not work for some reason. To check where the issues come from, compare the code on test.js and main.js and discover that google with `initMap()` function is causing the issue. This is discovered by making the function inactive. Think this is caused by `intiMap()` function loads before Google Maps API loads. To solve the issue, create another function to retrieve data from REST Countries API first, which works fine, however, does not look like the most efficient way of solving the issue so tries a few different ways and come up an idea to delay ‚ÄòinitMap()` function in `displayCountryInfo()` function by using `setTimeout()` method. Delay `initMap()` function by 3000 ms first and work fine, then try 1000 ms and work fine so put 0 ms just to see if that still works and for some reason, it works fine too so decided to use this method to solve the issue.<br>
([Game starts but text does not work](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/show-countries1.png) / [Record in GitHub to fix issue when draft of issue is updated](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/show-countries2.png))

> **Note:**<br>
> The issue is solved without me understanding the logic of it very well. Try a few different methods and somehow it works

**--- Invalid Value ---**<br>
`lat` and `lng` are two parameters to take selected country‚Äôs latitude and longitude for the function to show a country on Google Maps. Initially, these two parameters are used for `initMap()` function inside `displayCountryInfo()`
function to show a selected country on Google Maps. There are errors on console on Chrome DevTools that `lat` and `lng` are invalid value because they are **undefined** valuables, instead of number, when the page loads. To solve the issue, try to change lat and lng to number with `Number()` function, which does not work, so come up an idea to create another function to show a selected country on Google Maps and set default latitude and longitude with `initMap()` function so that no parameters are required and when `lat` and `lng` are used for a newly created `showCountryOnGoogleMaps( )` function, `lat` and `lng` are defined as number and can be taken as arguments.<br>
([Invalid value message and value of lat and lng](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/invalid-value1.png) / [New function that can take lat and lng](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game/blob/main/assets/readme/barriers-solutions/invalid-value2.png))

## VERSION CONTROL <a name="version-control-heading"></a>
I use **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** as a local repository and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control is;
1. Create a **remote repository** in GitHub by clicking **"New repository"** on the main page
2. Create a folder called **ms2-speed-typing-game** on my computer (e.g. Desktop)
3. Open the folder with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is my Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
4. Create README.md file
5. Create a **local repository** by using command line with ***git init*** command
6. First commit in git repository and first push to GitHub using the below commands;
````
* git add README.md
* git commit -m "Initial commit"
* git branch -M main
* git remote add origin https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms2-speed-typing-game.git
* git push -u origin main
````
7. From the second commit, the below process and commands are used. Whenever a section or even a group of work are completed, they are committed in git and pushed into GitHub, in order to make sure to keep the history of the work logged properly and not to lose the work by unexpected situations

````
* git status | To check the status of new / modified folders, files, and documents
* git add . | To put all new and updated work on the stage in git
* git commit -m "Example commit" | To commit the work on the stage in git before pushing it to GitHub
* git push | To update the repository in GitHub
